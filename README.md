# React

I have worked with different front-end developments such as HTML and JavaScript. To expound my knowledge, I have worked with React to rebuild the classic game, Tetris.

# Development Environment

I used React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Most of my files were .jsx.  I found this to format better when using JavaScript and HTML language in the same file.

# Future Work

* It spawns in random block shapes, but I need to work to keep the block when it is on the bottom and then spawn in another random shape.
* Adding a score component.
